## Redoing segmentation to get masks

Was the usage of command line argument `select_max` (ref: https://github.com/leiferlab/wormdatamodel/blob/2ab956199e3931de41a190d2b9985e961df3810c/wormdatamodel/signal/extraction.py#L177) recorded anywhere? For exact reproducibility I might need to or it might help to know

Same for `method` (including `weighted_mask`) and `box_size`

Also have concerns about how often small (including local and uncommitted) changes might have gone into that code; maybe just having the neuron indices would be sufficient?


# Code for generating figures from paper

I have found all information for this and have no further questions
